## Database

For the database I am using SQLite3 but I want it to be easy to swap out. However I change out my database I will still want it to be normalized.

I first can create tables from what my most basic entities are from my uml

Users(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    firstname VARCHAR(32),
    lastname VARCHAR(32),
    **email VARCHAR(32)**,
    username VARCHAR(32),
    **hashPass VARCHAR(64)**,
    registerDate DATE)

Houses(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ownerId INT FOREIGN KEY,
    name VARCHAR(32),
    **address Address**,
    available BOOLEAN,
    description TEXT,
    rooms INTEGER,
    bathrooms INTEGER,
    price FLOAT(10,2),
    from DATE,
    untill DATE)

HousePhotos(
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
    houseid INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Houses(id),
    photo BLOB NOT NULL)

    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    bookerId INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(id),
    houseId INT NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Houses(id),
    confirmed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
